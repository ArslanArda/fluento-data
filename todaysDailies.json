    {
      "user": "Hi! I’ve got a job interview coming up overseas, and I’m feeling a bit nervous. Can you help me prepare?",
      "assistant": "Absolutely! Interviewing abroad can be a great opportunity but also a bit challenging. Do you know what kind of interview it will be and what country it’s in?"
    },
    {
      "user": "It’s a tech position in Germany. They said it will be a panel interview over video call.",
      "assistant": "Great! Video panel interviews are common now. It’s important to get familiar with the cultural expectations and the technical setup. Are you comfortable with video calls?"
    },
    {
      "user": "Mostly, but I want to sound confident and culturally aware. What should I keep in mind about interviewing in Germany?",
      "assistant": "Germans generally appreciate punctuality, formality, and clear, direct communication. Make sure you join the video call a few minutes early and address interviewers respectfully."
    },
    {
      "user": "Got it. How about answering questions? Any tips on framing my answers?",
      "assistant": "Structure is key. Use the STAR method—Situation, Task, Action, Result—to answer behavioral questions clearly. Also, back your answers with examples from your experience."
    },
    {
      "user": "I’m worried about language barriers. The interview will be in English, but it might not be their first language. How do I handle that?",
      "assistant": "Speak slowly and clearly without exaggerating. It’s okay to ask politely for clarification if you don’t understand something. Showing your willingness to communicate effectively is positive."
    },
    {
      "user": "Should I prepare questions to ask them at the end?",
      "assistant": "Definitely! Asking thoughtful questions shows interest. For example, you can ask about the team’s culture, expectations for the role, or opportunities for growth."
    },
    {
      "user": "What about the follow-up? How soon should I send a thank-you message?",
      "assistant": "It’s best to send a brief thank-you email within 24 hours, expressing gratitude for the opportunity and reinforcing your enthusiasm."
    },
    {
      "user": "That sounds good. Any advice on dressing for the video interview?",
      "assistant": "Dress professionally, just as you would for an in-person interview. Avoid distracting patterns, and choose solid, neutral colors. Make sure your background is tidy and well-lit."
    },
    {
      "user": "Thanks a lot! I feel much more prepared now to tackle my job interview abroad.",
      "assistant": "You’re welcome! Stay calm and confident—you’ve got this. Good luck with your interview!"
